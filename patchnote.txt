Buglist as of Alpha v1.5
unsure
1. Can't delete Contractor Project or other many to many tables (or delete will delete all project associate with a specific contractor)
2. Updating Contractor Project will not delete old one and will also create a new one.
for sure
1. validations of max value and entity types for most if not all tables.
