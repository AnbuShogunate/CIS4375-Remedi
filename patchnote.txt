TodoList:
1. Need to add contractor to create flight page instead of edit page.
2. Need to display contractor in flight page.
3. Need to fix displayed time in flight edit page.
3.1 Need to change DB to where it wouldn't show the 'Z'






Buglist as of Beta v1.2
unsure
1. validations of max value and entity types for most tables. Especially for the names and addresses.
2. unable to add contractor to flight until flight has been created. -.-
3. edit flight page does not show the flight time.


Featurelist as of Beta v1.1
1. No need worry too much about duplicates for Contractors on Project since it'll automatically remove duplicates.
